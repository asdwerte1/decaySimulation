## General Plan

- The data will be downloaded and stored locally
- The data will then be parsed and cleansed to make usable for purposes (and remove additional unneeded data)
- For now intention is to simply store in a CSV
- However also toying with use of a local database (MySQL) and Connector for C++
	- The reason for this being that all isotope data (ground state) will be stored for completeness and future-proofing
	- A CSV may be cumbersome and slow for this purpose - will decide down the line
- Full details will be listed in Jupyter Notebook

For purposes of data processing Python will be used
